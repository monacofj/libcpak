	Libcpak - A C programmers' army knife

	IN BRIEF

	Libcpak is a convenience library for C programmers. It is meant as a 
	handy tool set to free developers from reimplementing often needed tasks
	such as handling linked lists and trees, performing operations on queues
	and stacks, checking for system calls' return status, processing command
        line options, managing dynamic arrays and matrixes and so on.  

	Warning:

	As of this writing Libcpak is a work on progress in its early stage
	of development.  Be prepared for bugs and incomplete features.

	THE WHOLE HISTORY

	CPAK stands for "C Programmers' Army Kife". Libcpak is intended as 
	collection o simple to advanced resources for developers so that one
	does not need to reimplement often needed functions and data structures.

	Libcpak is not a replacement for GNU Glib

	And the history begins more or less like this:

	Once upon a time there was a small library...  (to be continued).


	QUICK REFERENCE
	
	* Libcpak if free software; see COPYING for license information.

	* Building and installing: refer to INSTALL. 
	  Quick start: ./configure && make && make install. 

	* Libcpak documentation is ongoing. For now, you may refer directly
	  to the source code.

	* Refer to file DEVELOPERS.

	SOME NOTES

	Libcpak is not a replacement for GLib (www.gtk.org). Both have
	similar purposes but different design principles and feature set.
	
	Libpack is built on top of libc and nothing else (no other library);

	Libcapk is strictly compliant to standard C (C89) and POSIX.
