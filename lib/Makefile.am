# Reminder for libcpak.la versioning
#
# Versioning: CURRENT:REVISION:AGE
# CURRENT The latest interface implemented.
# REVISION The implementation number of CURRENT (read: number of bugs fixed...)
# AGE The number of interfaces implemented, minus one.
# The library supports all interfaces between CURRENT âˆ’ AGE and CURRENT.
#
# If you have 
# not changed the interface (bug fixes)		CURRENT : REVISION+1 : AGE
# augmented the interface (new functions)	CURRENT+1 : 0 : AGE+1
# broken old interface (e.g. removed functions) CURRENT+1 : 0 : 0
